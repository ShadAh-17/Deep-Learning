Its a dataset of a bank.
If you scroll down to the bottom there's going to be 10 thousand customers. So 10 thousand rows in this dataset.
And what the bank did is they measured some things about these customers.

The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates. So churn is when people leave the company and they've seen customers leaving at unusually
high rates and they want to understand what the problem is and they want to assess and address that problem.

This bank has millions of customers, it operates, this fictional bank operates in Europe and three countries France, Spain, and Germany.
Their custom ID, their surname, credit score, their geography, their agenda, their age, their tenure, so how long they've been with 
the bank, the balance of the customers at that point in time, the number of products they had at that point in time.
So the number of products is things like how many products do they have, do they have a savings account, do they have a credit card,
do they have a loan, did the customer have a credit card or not, so there's a yes/no flag, is the customer an active member, 
another yes/no flag.

So we are going to look into the matter, what cause the customers to exit.
