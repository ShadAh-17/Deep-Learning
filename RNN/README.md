The train data, that contains the Google stock price from beginning 2012 to the end of 2016,
and then the test data that contains the first month of 2017, that is, the whole financial month of January 2017.
So I have built a RNN model to predict Stock Price.


How one can approach this problem?
well, I have trained our LSTM model on the five years of the Google stock price, and this is from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2016 and then, based on this training, based on the correlations identified or captured by the LSTM of the Google stock price,
I have tried to predict the first month of 2017 i.e., to predict January 2017. 
Exact Prediction of Stock Price are impossible, but the upward or downward trend of the Stock Price is Possible.
